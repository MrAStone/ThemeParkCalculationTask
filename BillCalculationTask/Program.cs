               Write a C# program to calculate the total charge for a group of people visiting the theme park.
               The program must:
                • get the user to enter the number of people in a group
                • calculate the total charge by:
                    ○ charging £15 per person
                    ○ reducing the total charge by £5 if there are six or more people
                • output the total charge.
            You should use meaningful variable name(s) inyour answer.
